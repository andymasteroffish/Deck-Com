Deck-Com Intro script

**Goal**

Defeat all enemies in each level.


**Controls**

WASD to move camera
Scroll to zoom

The game mostly uses the mouse.


**Cards**

Each unit has their own deck of cards. At the end of each turn, they discard their existing hand and draw 4 new cards. When their deck runs out, their discard pile is shuffled and becomes a new deck.

By default, all cards cost 1 action to play and units have 2 actions per turn. Action cost is shown in the bottom left corner of the card (This number includes any effects that would modify cost).

You can switch units freely during your turn, and can have units play cards in any order.


**Cover**

Cover affects standard attacks. Units in partial cover have damaged reduced by one. Units in full cover take half damage. Cover effects (and any other effects that would affect damage) are shown when mousing over a unit while playing an attack card.


**Equipment**

All units have an equipped weapon that will determine the range and damage of their attack cards (as well as any other potential effects).

Other equipment cards can be played. These cards stay on the unit and do not go to the discard pile until they are destroyed.


**Deck Building**

Loot can be collected (as a free action) and will turn into a booster pack at the end of the level.

In between levels, new cards can be added to the unit decks for $2 per card level.


**Store**

You can access the store in between levels by collecting the key. Collect the key by moving one of your units on top of it.


**Notes on this build**

You can quit the game on the deck building scene and it will save your progress

Right now all of your units need to be killed to reach a game over. If any survive, the dead units will come back at the end of the round.

There is no store yet, but that will be a secondary use for money.
